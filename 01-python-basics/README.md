# Python Basics

This folder contains basic Python exercises focused on file handling,
string manipulation, and dictionary usage.

## Text Analyzer
Analyzes a text file, counts words, and displays the most frequent terms.

## What I Learned
Through this project, I practiced Python fundamentals such as:
- File handling
- String normalization
- Working with lists and dictionaries
- Using standard libraries ("collections", "json")
- Structuring code into reusable functions 

## Challenges
While developing this script, I initially made mistakes when trying to
modularize the code. I mixed responsibilities between functions and printed
results inside them instead of handling output in the `main` function.

## Improvements
I focused on clearly defining the responsibility of each function and
refactoring the code to make it more modular, readable, and reusable.
This helped me better understand clean code principles in Python.
